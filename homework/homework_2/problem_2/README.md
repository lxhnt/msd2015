### 2. Logistic regression for article classification

In this problem you will use logistic regression to build a text classifier that predicts the section that an article from the New York Times (NYT) belongs to based on the words it contains.

``business.tsv`` contains 1000 recent articles from the Business section of the NYT and ``world.tsv`` contains 1000 recent articles from the World section.
``get_nyt_articles_by_section.R`` was used to create these files, and is included for completeness, but does not need to be run.

Read in each file and use tools from the ``tm`` package---specifically ``VectorSource``, ``Corpus``, and ``DocumentTermMatrix``---to parse the article collection.
Then convert it to a ``sparseMatrix`` (code provided) where each row corresponds to one article and each column to one word, and a non-zero entry indicates that an article contains that word.

Then create an 80% train / 20% test split of the data and use ``cv.glmnet`` to find a best-fit logistic regression model that maximizes area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the training data.
Provide a plot of the cross-validation curve from ``cv.glmnet``.
Quote the accuracy and AUC on the test data and use the ``ROCR`` package to provide a plot of the ROC curve for the test data.
Also show weights on words with top 10 weights for "business" and weights on words with the top 10 weights for "world".
