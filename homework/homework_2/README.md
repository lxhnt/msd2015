The first problem looks at cross-validation for polynomial regression.
The second problem uses logistic regression to build an article classifier.
Details are in the README.md file for each problem.

Your code and a brief report with your results are to be submitted electronically in one zipped (or tarball-ed) file through the [CourseWorks](https://courseworks.columbia.edu/portal/site/APMAE4990_001_2015_1) site. All code should be contained in plain text files and should produce the exact results you provide in your writeup. Code should be written in R and should not have complex dependencies on non-standard libraries. The report should simply present your answers to the questions in an organized format as either a plain text or pdf file.
